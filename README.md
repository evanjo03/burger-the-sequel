# node-express-handlebars (with Sequelize)

The application is a basic full-stack burger-storing application with a SQL DB.  The app uses express.js, mysql, modularization, and uses the ORM Sequelize to simplify CRUD requests to a Node.js server.  Additionally, I used handlebars.js express template engine to simplify the front-end of the application, but in the end, the application was a single page, so the templates were not entirely necessary - good practice though!
